#### Task 5: README and API Documentation
Be sure to document your game. Your README file should include:

1. Instructions for playing the game
2. Detailed descriptions of each endpoint

Remember, you are documenting an API that another programmer may want to use as the basis for a web or mobile app.
An api user should *not* need to read the source code to understand how to use it.
You may follow the format of 'Guess a Number' for your README.

### Reflect on Your Design
Document your design decisions by answering the following questions:
   
- What additional properties did you add to your models and why?
- What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?

These answers should be in a file Design.txt.
Your responses can be in paragraph form or bulleted lists.
This document should be around 500 words long.



#Hangman Game API

## Set-Up Instructions:
1.  Update the value of application in app.yaml to the app ID you have registered
 in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of hangman.
2.  Run the app with the devserver using dev_appserver.py DIR, and ensure it's
 running by visiting the API Explorer - by default localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer.
3.  (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with the endpoints tool.
 Deploy your application.
 
##Game Description:
Hangman is a guessing game. Each game begins with a random 'target' word taken
from a list of zoo animals in wordbank.py, as well as a maximum number of
'attempts.' A 'guess' is sent to the `make_move` endpoint which will reply with
the board (stars [*] represent a blank for each letter of the word), and with the
message 'You got one!', 'Not in word!', 'game over', or 'you win!' Many different
Hangman games can be played by many different users at any given time. Each game
can be retrieved or played using the path parameter `urlsafe_game_key`.

##Files Included:
 - api.py: Contains endpoints and game playing logic.
 - app.yaml: App configuration.
 - cron.yaml: Cronjob configuration.
 - main.py: Handler for taskqueue handler.
 - models.py: Entity and message definitions including helper methods.
 - utils.py: Helper function for retrieving ndb.Models by urlsafe Key string.

##Endpoints Included:
 - **create_user**
    - Path: 'user'
